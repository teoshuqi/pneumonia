# Pneumonia Detection using X-Rays
* Detecting pneumonia with CNNs and pre trained models


## Problem
Using Deep learning methods (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify pneunomia using xrays.


## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The dataset consists of 3 types of pneumonia xrays categorised under 2 classes. Firstly, the normal xrays with no pneumonia. Secondly, the xrays with bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia

## Methods

Firstly, a baseline model using simple CNN is created. 
Secondly, to get better results, pretrained model is fine tuned by replacing and retraining the classification head.
